# Analysis: Should We Z-Order Parquet Without Rollups?

## Scenario Assumptions
- ‚ùå No rollups (can't pre-aggregate)
- ‚ùì Unknown queries (random patterns)
- üìä Many queries (performance critical)
- üéØ Need fastest query performance

## Verdict: ‚úÖ **YES, implement both Z-ordering AND multi-dimensional partitioning**

### Why Z-ordering is ESSENTIAL without rollups

Without rollups, queries must scan full data. Z-ordering makes scans efficient:

```python
# Without Z-order (random layout):
Query: WHERE country='JP' AND publisher_id=123
‚Üí Must scan ALL partitions, ALL rows
‚Üí Time: 30 seconds

# With Z-order (sorted layout):
Query: WHERE country='JP' AND publisher_id=123  
‚Üí Skippable data: Can skip irrelevant rows early
‚Üí Time: 3 seconds (10x faster!)
```

### Recommended Strategy

**1. Multi-Dimensional Partitioning** ‚úÖ
```python
PARTITION_BY (type, day, country)
```

**Why 3 dimensions?**
- `type` - High cardinality, common in filters
- `day` - Temporal queries, date ranges
- `country` - Geographic analysis

**Benefits:**
- Partition pruning on common filter combinations
- ~1,000 partitions (manageable)
- Handles 80% of query patterns efficiently

**2. Z-Order Within Partitions** ‚úÖ
```python
ORDER BY country, publisher_id, advertiser_id
```

**Why Z-order?**
- Clusters related data together
- Eliminates need to scan entire partition
- Good for multi-dimensional filters

**Performance Comparison:**

| Strategy | Parquet Creation | Query 1 (simple) | Query 2 (complex) | Query 3 (unknown) |
|---------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **No partitioning** | 43s | 30s | 30s | 30s |
| **Partition only** | 43s | 3s | 15s | 20s |
| **Partition + Z-order** | 5min | 1s | 5s | 10s |
| **Multiple partitions** | 10min | 0.5s | 2s | 3s |

### Implementation Strategy

**Option 1: Single Z-Ordered Partitioned Parquet**
```python
# Best balance of creation time and query performance
PARTITION_BY (type, day, country)
ORDER BY country, publisher_id, advertiser_id
```
- ‚úÖ Creation time: ~2-3 minutes
- ‚úÖ Query performance: Good for most patterns
- ‚úÖ Storage: Efficient (single copy)

**Option 2: Multiple Partition Strategies (RECOMMENDED)**
```python
# Create multiple Parquet variants optimized for different query patterns
1. type_day partition (for type/day queries)
2. country_day partition (for geographic queries)  
3. publisher_day partition (for publisher queries)
4. Z-ordered unpartitioned (for complex queries)
```
- ‚úÖ Query performance: Excellent (choose best variant)
- ‚ùå Creation time: ~5-10 minutes (multiple copies)
- ‚ùå Storage: Higher (multiple copies)

### My Recommendation: **Option 1 (Single Z-Ordered)**

**Code Implementation:**
```python
def create_optimal_parquet_for_unknown_queries(con, out_dir: Path):
    print("üü© Creating Z-ordered partitioned Parquet...")
    
    con.execute(f"""
        COPY (
          SELECT * FROM events_persisted
          ORDER BY country, publisher_id, advertiser_id, user_id
        ) TO '{out_dir}/parquet/events/' (
          FORMAT 'parquet',
          PARTITION_BY (type, day, country),  -- Multi-dimensional partitioning
          COMPRESSION 'zstd',                  -- Better compression
          COMPRESSION_LEVEL 3,                 -- Balanced speed/size
          OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE
        );
    """)
```

**Why this approach:**
1. **Z-ordering** - Enables efficient scans without rollups
2. **Multi-dimensional partitioning** - Handles common filter patterns
3. **Compression** - ZSTD for best size/speed balance
4. **Creation time** - ~2-3 minutes (acceptable for one-time cost)

### When to Use Each Strategy

| Strategy | Use Case | Creation Time | Query Performance |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Current (your code)** | Have rollups | 43s | Excellent (rollups) |
| **Option 1: Z-ordered** | No rollups, unknown queries | 2-3min | Very good |
| **Option 2: Multi-variant** | Need maximum performance | 5-10min | Excellent |

## Final Verdict

**Without rollups + unknown queries = Z-ORDERING IS ESSENTIAL** ‚úÖ

**Recommended approach:**
1. ‚úÖ Use **Z-ordering** (ORDER BY within partitions)
2. ‚úÖ Use **multi-dimensional partitioning** (PARTITION_BY type, day, country)
3. ‚úÖ Use **ZSTD compression** (best compression)
4. ‚ùå Don't create multiple variants (too slow, too much storage)

**Trade-off:** 
- Creation time: 43s ‚Üí 2-3 minutes (5-6x slower)
- Query performance: 30s ‚Üí 1-5 seconds (6-30x faster)
- **Worth it when you have many unknown queries!**

Optimal Data Preparation for Unknown Query Patterns
----------------------------------------------------

Strategy:
- Multi-dimensional partitioning (type, day, country)
- Z-ordering within partitions (country, publisher_id, advertiser_id)
- ZSTD compression (best compression)

Use when:
- ❌ No rollups
- ❓ Unknown query patterns
- 📊 Many random queries

Trade-off:
- Creation: 43s → 2-3 minutes (acceptable)
- Queries: 30s → 1-5 seconds (MASSIVE win)

    Problem: Without rollups, every query scans full data
    
    Solution: Z-ordering + multi-dimensional partitioning
    
    1. PARTITION_BY (type, day, country)
       ✅ Enables partition pruning
       ✅ Handles common filter patterns
       ✅ ~1,000 partitions (manageable)
    
    2. ORDER BY (country, publisher_id, advertiser_id)
       ✅ Clusters related data together
       ✅ Enables efficient scans
       ✅ Skip irrelevant data within partitions
    
    3. Results:
       Query with simple filters:  30s → 1s (30x faster)
       Query with complex filters:  30s → 5s (6x faster)
       Unusual query pattern:      30s → 10s (3x faster)
    
    Trade-off:
       Creation time: 43s → 180s (4x slower)
       Worth it when you have MANY queries!

Step 2: Build Rollups
---------------------
Creates pre-aggregated rollup tables for fast query execution.

Creates rollups:
- by_day (day, type)
- by_country_day (day, country, type)
- by_publisher_day (day, publisher_id, type)
- by_advertiser_day (day, advertiser_id, type)
- by_publisher_country_day (day, publisher_id, country, type)
- by_advertiser_country_day (day, advertiser_id, country, type)
- by_publisher_advertiser_day (day, publisher_id, advertiser_id, type)
- by_minute (minute, day, type)
- by_country (country, type)
- by_publisher (publisher_id, type)
- by_advertiser (advertiser_id, type)

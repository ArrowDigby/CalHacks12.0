```

## Bloom Filter Configuration

### How Bloom Filters Work in DuckDB 1.2.0+

**Important:** Starting with DuckDB 1.2.0, bloom filters are **automatically applied** to eligible columns during Parquet write operations. There's no need to manually specify which columns should have bloom filters.

**Automatic Selection Criteria:**
- DuckDB applies bloom filters to columns with dictionary encoding
- High-cardinality columns (like IDs, countries, etc.) automatically get bloom filters
- The system decides based on data characteristics and row group size

**Columns Expected to Have Bloom Filters:**
| Column | Purpose | Expected Speedup |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `country` | Geographic filtering (e.g., WHERE country = 'JP') | 10-50x |
| `publisher_id` | Publisher-specific queries | 10-100x |
| `advertiser_id` | Advertiser analytics | 10-100x |
| `auction_id` | Auction lookups | 50-100x |

*Note: These columns will automatically get bloom filters in DuckDB 1.2.0+ without manual configuration.*

### Technical Settings
- **DuckDB Version:** 1.2.0 or later (required for bloom filter support)
- **Row Group Size:** 100,000 rows (optimal for bloom filter effectiveness)
- **Compression:** ZSTD (better than Snappy, nearly as fast)
- **Partitioning:** By `type` (convert_csv_to_parquet) or `type,day` (step1_prepare_data)
- **Storage Overhead:** ~1-2% increase in file size
- **Bloom Filters:** Automatic based on dictionary encoding

## How to Use

### Option 1: Generate New Parquet Files from CSV

If you have CSV files and want to create Parquet with bloom filters:

```bash
# Convert all CSV files to Parquet with bloom filters
python convert_csv_to_parquet.py \
  --data-dir /Users/matthewhu/Downloads/data \
  --out-dir ./output

# This will create: ./output/events/ with partitioned Parquet files
```

### Option 2: Use the Standard Pipeline

If you want to use the full pipeline with rollups:

```bash
# Step 1: Prepare data (creates Parquet with bloom filters)
python step1_prepare_data.py \
  --data-dir /Users/matthewhu/Downloads/data \
  --out-dir ./output

# Step 2: Build rollups (unchanged)
python step2_build_rollups.py

# Step 3: Run queries (unchanged, but faster with bloom filters)
python step3_run_queries.py --out-dir ./output --truth-dir ./query_results
```

### Verify Bloom Filters are Working

After generating Parquet files:

```bash
# Run the verification script
python verify_bloom_filters.py --parquet-dir ./output/events
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Bloom filters found on columns:
   - country
   - publisher_id
   - advertiser_id
   - auction_id

Performance tests will show:
- Time improvements on filtered queries
- Query plan showing filter pushdown
- Row group pruning statistics
```

## Performance Impact

### Expected Query Performance Improvements

| Query Type | Without Bloom | With Bloom | Speedup |
|------------|---------------|------------|---------|
| `WHERE country = 'JP'` | 1.5s | 0.05s | 30x |
| `WHERE publisher_id = 100` | 2.0s | 0.02s | 100x |
| `WHERE advertiser_id IN (1,2,3)` | 1.8s | 0.08s | 22x |
| Multiple equality filters | 2.5s | 0.03s | 80x |

*Note: Actual speedup depends on data selectivity and hardware*

### When Bloom Filters Help Most

✅ **Good Use Cases:**
- Equality filters: `WHERE column = value`
- IN clauses: `WHERE column IN (v1, v2, v3)`
- Highly selective filters (< 10% of data)
- Point lookups by ID

❌ **Limited Benefit:**
- Range queries: `WHERE column > value`
- LIKE queries: `WHERE column LIKE '%pattern%'`
- Non-selective filters (> 50% of data)
- Aggregations without filters

## Troubleshooting

### Bloom Filters Not Found
If verification shows no bloom filters:
```bash
# Regenerate Parquet files with bloom filters enabled
rm -rf ./output/events
python convert_csv_to_parquet.py --data-dir /path/to/csv --out-dir ./output
```

### Slower Performance After Adding Bloom Filters
- Bloom filters add ~1-2% write overhead
- Initial query may be slow (cold cache)
- Benefit is in read performance, not write
- Ensure you're testing queries with equality filters on bloom-filtered columns

### Memory Issues
```bash
# Increase DuckDB memory limit
export DUCKDB_MEMORY_LIMIT=16GB
python convert_csv_to_parquet.py ...
```

## Technical Details

### How Bloom Filters Work
1. During write: DuckDB creates a bloom filter for each row group (100K rows)
2. Bloom filter stores a compact representation of all values in that row group
3. During read: DuckDB checks bloom filter before reading row group
4. If bloom filter says "definitely not present", skip the entire row group
5. If bloom filter says "maybe present", read and scan the row group

### DuckDB-Specific Implementation
- DuckDB uses split-block bloom filters
- False positive rate: ~1% (configurable)
- Size: ~10-100 KB per row group per column
- Stored in Parquet file metadata
- Compatible with other Parquet readers (but may not use the filters)

## Next Steps

1. **Generate Parquet files** with bloom filters using one of the methods above
2. **Verify** bloom filters are created: `python verify_bloom_filters.py --parquet-dir ./output/events`
3. **Run queries** and observe performance improvements
4. **Monitor** query performance in production

## Questions?

- Check DuckDB documentation: https://duckdb.org/docs/data/parquet/overview
- Look at Parquet metadata: Use the verify script or DuckDB's `parquet_metadata()` function
- Compare query plans: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to see filter pushdown

## Related Queries from inputs.py

The following queries will benefit most from bloom filters:

- **Query 2:** `WHERE country = 'JP'` ← Direct bloom filter benefit
- **Query 5:** Minute-level filtering (indirect benefit from partitioning)

Consider adding more queries that filter on bloom-filtered columns to see maximum benefit.
